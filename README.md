# KNN
Have performed **Classification** type K-Nearest Neighbors on **Iris and Ionosphere dataset**.
Algorithm for KNN was created from scratch wherein no direct functions were used, except for to split the dataset into train and test datasets.
In the Iris dataset, we have the label set Y={0,1,2} and in the Ionosphere dataset, we have the label set Y={+1 for good and -1 for bad}.
